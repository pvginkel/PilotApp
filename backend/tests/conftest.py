"""Pytest configuration and fixtures.

Infrastructure fixtures (app, client, session, OIDC, SSE) are defined in
conftest_infrastructure.py. This file re-exports them and adds app-specific
domain fixtures.

A fixture defined here after the import replaces the template's fixture of
the same name. To change the settings the test apps are built from, replace
``test_settings`` or ``test_app_settings``. With a database they are
session-scoped, because the app is, and a replacement keeps that scope.
